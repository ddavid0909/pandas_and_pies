1. Data extraction. Data from the large xlxs file stored in the reetrxlxs.rtf is filtered out, so that only legal entities that work in construction and that represent enterprises of small or medium size remains. This is done using Power Query in Excel.
2. Data cleaning. Getting rid of unnecessary columns that definitely yield no useful information to research that is about to be performed on the data in order to reduce the size of the data structures that will be created upon the given file. All of this is done in Excel to simplify the process.
