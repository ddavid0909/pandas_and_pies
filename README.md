# pandas_and_pies
This data analysis project focuses on using Python's libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib and Excel to extract useful data from a dataset and visualise it in order to offer helpful insight and ease future decision making.
Used libraries:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Geopandas

Used technologies:
1. Excel
2. Python (in jupyter notebooks)

The project is done in Jupyter notebooks.

1. Data extraction. Data from the large xlxs file stored in the reetrxlxs.rtf is filtered out, so that only legal entities that work in construction and that represent enterprises of small or medium size remains. This is done using Power Query in Excel.
2. Data cleaning. Getting rid of unnecessary columns that definitely yield no useful information to research that is about to be performed on the data in order to reduce the size of the data structures that will be created upon the given file. All of this is done in Excel to simplify the process.
3. Additional data collection via an undocumented API through requests Python module.
